##Sums of two squares

In additive number theory, Pierre de Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares states that an odd prime p is expressible as
p=x^2 +y^2, p = x^2 + y^2 with x and y integers, if and only if   p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}.

[hermite-serret.py](https://github.com/macbuse/just-math/blob/master/hermite-serret.py)
calculates x, y so that x^2 + y^2 = p for prime p = 1 mod 4
